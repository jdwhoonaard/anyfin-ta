This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Moonshot Summary

Because I was in a hurry to finish this assignment before the end of the weekend I put an API key in this project. With more time I probably would have been attentive and this would not have happened. Furthermore I had some problems getting the correct exchange rates from the API, because of this I had to look for alternatives. Also I think fetching this data every time you convert is a bit much, with more time I would have changed so it's only fetched when the App is being mounted.

Furthermore I think this code would have been much cleaner if I had used a central store instead of this.state. This would have made it possible to cut up the app in 4 components: Search, Result, Exchange and Map. With this approach the App would have been much more flexible, it would create the possibility to show multiple results at once or the simplify the implementation of new (=cooler) visualisation. Also I was thinking about incorporating the Big Mac Index to visualise the difference in cost of living by the size of a Burger.svg. Also I would have prefered to render the countries metadata inside the map but this became visually unapealling and therefor I put it on top of the map.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
